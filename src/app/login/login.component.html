        Rotten Tomatoes and the Tomatometer score are the world’s most trusted
        recommendation resources for quality entertainment. As the leading online
        aggregator of movie and TV show reviews from critics, we provide fans with a
        comprehensive guide to what’s Fresh – and what’s Rotten – in theaters and at home.
        And the Tomatometer is just the beginning. We also serve movie and TV fans with original
        editorial content on our site and through social channels, produce fun and informative video series,
        and hold live events for fans across the country, with our ‘Your Opinion Sucks’ live shows.
        If you’re an entertainment fan looking for a recommendation, or to share an opinion, you’ve come to
        the right place.
